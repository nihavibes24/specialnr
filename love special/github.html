     Dear Rishi🤍,
    </span>

    <p id="message">
        You are an amazing person and the most unique one.<br>
        I have never seen such a great person like you. 
            You are something special💖.<br>
            I really like you because of your behaviour and respect towards others especially girls. <br>
            I feel,A man with manners & respect is a real definition of "Handsome"<br> & You are Handsome💕<br>
               Your simplicity tells your authenticity,humility and grounded nature.<br>
               You always appear to be genuine and true.<br>
                Your personality,behaviour shows your character.<br>
                    Your helping nature stems a deep sense of empathy.<br>
                   The way You prioritize the needs of others,often putting them ahead of your own, without expecting anything in return shows your humbale character.<br>
                  People around you are sooo lucky<br>
                  Loving a person without seeing them everyday is a proof that loves doesnot come from the eyes but from heart...<br>
                  Moreover,Try to learn new things and stay focused.<br>
                  Remember, every step you take builds towards your success. Believe in your journey—great things are ahead!  <br>
                      Our support will always be with you<br>
